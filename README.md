# Dining Web Project

This project is to create a basic website from scratch that matches the BYU Dining Services theme. The purpose of this is to test your basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Please do not spend more than 3 hours on this project. 


### Project Description

Create a dynamic page for E.A.T. that changes content based on what the user clicks. See photos for details. 

### Requirements:

  - BYU header with links (http://dining.byu.edu/styleguide/header.html)
  - Change the top banner image based on the food that is clicked. Corresponding banners will be found in the images folder. 
  - Change the `.eat-description` based on the class that is clicked. 
  - BYU footer with links (http://dining.byu.edu/styleguide/footer.html)
  - BONUS: if you can make it mobile friendly that changes `.eat-container` to `display: block;` when the page shrinks below 800px.
